# FaroShuffle

This project is implemented within the official C # documentation (link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/working-with-linq)

## As a result, topics such as:

1) using LINQ queries to aggregate data into meaningful sequences;
2) Writing extension methods to add your own functionality to LINQ queries
3) Identifying areas in your code where LINQ queries can run into performance problems, such as slowdowns.
4) lazy and eager evaluate LINQ queries and their impact on query performance.

In addition to LINQ, this project implements the algorithms used by magicians for card tricks: shuffling Faro (out shuffle and in shuffle of the deck) - which allow you to control where each card in the deck is moved.
